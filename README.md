MessageACP
===============================

Provides the com.woltlab.wcf.message functions in the ACP.

Version notes
-------------

The master branch always represents the latest released version of the files and is updated simultaneously with the WCF.
The dev branch contains the latest changes of the files in the WCF, even if they are not yet represented in a WCF release.

Branch structure
----------------

* master Contains tagged release versions.
* dev The development happens here. Whenever a release is stable and complete, it gets merged into master. Pull requests are merged into dev and start from there. That's why dev is the default branch of the repository.
